# Strategy

## Core Principles
- Speed over polish  
- Application-layer focus (storytelling, not just playlists)  
- Agentic workflows for set-building  

## Strategic Bets
- AI narrative arcs will differentiate us  
- Multilingual subtitles (FR/ENG/ES) will give global reach  
- Stage/demo integration will make Symphonia a showcase product  

## Success Criteria
- 1k DJs actively testing by month 6  
- 3 festival showcases (demo stage)  
- Viral clips of multilingual "music stories" circulating online
