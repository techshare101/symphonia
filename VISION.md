# Vision

## Mission
To transform DJing into storytelling with music — weaving tempo, lyrics, and multilingual subtitles into arcs that carry audiences on emotional journeys.

## Problem
DJs spend hours digging, ordering, and preparing tracks to create flow. Audiences often miss lyrical meaning due to language barriers, losing the deeper story behind the music.

## Why Now
- AI music analysis (BPM/key detection) is mature.
- Whisper & GPT-5 enable fast lyric transcription + translation.
- Live events are shifting toward immersive, narrative-driven experiences.

## Long-Term Impact
Symphonia makes every DJ set a universal narrative, accessible across cultures. If we succeed, music becomes not just heard, but understood and felt globally.
